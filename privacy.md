# Privacy Policy for WhatWord

**Last updated: August 04, 2025**

WhatWord ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we handle and why.

### Information We Handle

Our goal is to collect as little information as possible. The data we handle is essential for the app's functionality.

**1. Information You Provide:**

*   **Player Name:** You provide a name to identify yourself in the game. This name is stored locally on your device. During a multiplayer SharePlay game, this name is shared with other players in the session but not saved on their device.
*   **Custom Decks:** If you create your own decks, all titles, descriptions, and card content are stored locally on your device. We do not see, collect, or upload this content.
*   **AI-Generated Deck Themes:** When you use the AI feature, the theme text you enter (e.g., "Marvel Movies") is sent to our secure server solely to process the request and generate the deck. This theme text is not logged, stored, or associated with any personal identifiers.
*   **Deck Image Search:** When you search for a deck image, the deck's title is sent to the Brave Search API to find relevant images. This is subject to [Brave's Privacy Policy](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/privacy-policy).

**2. Information Handled by Apple:**

*   **Game Center:** We use Apple's Game Center service to get your player display name, which can be used to pre-fill your in-game name. Your interaction with Game Center is governed by Apple's policies.
*   **SharePlay:** Multiplayer games are powered by Apple's SharePlay. During a session, game data (like scores and player names) is synced between participants' devices. This process is managed by Apple's SharePlay framework.
*   **In-App Purchases:** All "WhatWord Pro" purchases are processed securely by the Apple App Store. We do not receive, process, or store any of your payment information, such as credit card numbers.

### Analytics

WhatWord does not use any third-party analytics or advertising services. We do not track you.

### Data Security

Communication with our server for the AI generation feature is protected by industry-standard encryption (TLS with certificate pinning).
